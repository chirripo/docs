Before you do, please read the following guidelines. Submission context \u00b6 Got a question or problem? \u00b6 Please submit an issue to the issue tracker . We will reply back as soon as possible. Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our GitHub repository . Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines. Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker , maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template. Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development: Fork the project, set up the development environment, make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits. Test: Before submitting a pull requests, test all of your changes. To do so, you can add the project to any existing PHP project by using Composer Path Repository (you can use TravisCI setup as an example). This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the package should at all times be installable through Packagist. Pull Request: After building the theme, commit the compiled output, push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to chirripo/chirripo:master. If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR. At all times, please ensure the automated build passes so that a minimal amount of tests are passed for your code. After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Are you interested in contributing to Chirripo?
